I completed my training with this 2 year school cycle to improve my technical knowledge, work in the industry (I spent half
of the time at the office) and learn how to become an engineer.
            
Beside the technical things I've learnt, I mostly discovered how to gather the client's needs, write **specifications**,
**organize development tasks** or ensure product stability through **unit testing**.
