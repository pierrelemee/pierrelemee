For my first experience as a developer I had the chance to join the R&D team of [Orange Labs](https://laborange.fr/). My
mission was to:
            
* setting up a gateway between the Livebox (internet connection box) and the Orange web radios catalog in **Java** relying
upon the **UPnP** protocol
* designed, developing and testing the media server providing web radios from the Orange web service to all connected devices,
discovering web services (in both **REST** and **SOAP**)

**Tech stack:** Java, UPnP (Cybergarage framework), REST & SOAP web services
