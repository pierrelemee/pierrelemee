### Intro {.section-title .intro-title}

To me, software development is like **a construction game**: by assembling blocks of different sizes, colors and shapes and an endless imagination you can turn any idea to a living, solid and palpable **realization**. Making any outline to a realistic project.

This is who I am then: a 34-years old **passionated** developer / playful kid. I'm constantly investigating on how buildings / softwares / frameworks are made, **curious** about how the things truly work. I love to be a builder, stacking line of codes, setting up algorithms, structuring objects and designing the map of my projects. I'm a Web, Linux and Open Source lover, I know how to design, code, test, deploy, query and automatize. I'm a **software builder** .
