After graduating university, I decided to become a freelance web developer to strengthen my web development skills. I designed,
created, delivered and maintained websites for various organizations and customers (such as [Les Blotteries](http://www.les-blotteries.com)
or [DÃ©co Styl](http://www.deco-styl.com)

This introduced me to:
* customer relationship management, delivery meetings
* developing and maintaining several websites with dedicated databases and rich Internet applications
* legal, financial and administrative requirements

**Tech stack:** PHP, MySQL, CSS, Javascript, Actionscript, Gimp
