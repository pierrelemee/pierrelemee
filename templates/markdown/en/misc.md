Beside my maternal language, French obviously, I speak a **fluent English**, I could attend a conversation in **Spanish**
and can identify words in **Italian** or **Swedish**.

On my spare time I enjoy watching films and TV shows. Whenever I can I listen to music (mostly electronic, ambient, rock and jazz).
I am a **golf** addict, but I also sometimes play **tennis** or **jog** if I'm not too lazy.

I like to taste a good **wine**, **beer** or **whisky**, or play **mots fléchés** (french equivalent of crossword puzzles)
while drinking my morning coffee.
            
I currently live in the 12th district of Paris.
